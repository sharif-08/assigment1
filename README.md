 Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
   Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
   if user give first input: 5
   and second input: 10
   then user get
	Addition: 15
 python get first and scond input and add them both
	Subtraction:-5
	Multiplication:50
Division:0.5
if usser divide by zero it get zero division error:
#task 2
user give first name:john
and second name:doe
then name get concanet by using + and give the result
